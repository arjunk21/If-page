        <p class="lead">
          The LeadFollow platform stack has a full suite of technologies that can be layered into your campaign which is optimized around your goals. The graphics below shows a lot of information, but the gist is that the LeadFollow platform is all about stalking your leads online to subconsciously influence buying intent. So no matter where they are, no matter where they are in the customer lifecycle.</p>
        <p class="lead">
        We know that your customers are researching right now online, they are reading blogs, articles and watching videos. And the sad fact is they may not know you exist or even worse have forgotten you exist. They may start to know the type of products that they want or they’re really in the buying stage or they could have been past clients that you’re trying to reactivate and re-engage.</p>
         <p class="lead">
        LeadFollow is perfect for every application of the entire customer lifecycle. I’m going to briefly explain some of the elements of our platform in a high-level. Just a reminder, we’ve got a much more detailed webinar that explain each one of these applications in detail.</p>

        <h1 class="text-center">Understanding the LeadFollow Platform Stack</h1>
        <p class="lead">As part of our LeadFollow platform stack we have a full suite of technologies that we can layer to design a campaign that is optimized around your goals. <i>This is what makes LeadFollow different from our competition. Plus we can get started for as little as $500/month!</i> </p>
        <h3 class="text-center">LeadFollow specializes in Lead Optimization</h3>
        <p class="lead">
          We typically break your campaigns into two elements. This allows us to use our platform different based on the goal of targeting your existing audience or trying to attract new customers.</p>
          <ol>
          <li class="lead">Existing Audience Lead Optimization</li>
          <li class="lead">New Audience Acquisition</li>
          </ol>
        <p class="lead">
        As a platform we publish your banner and video ads to over 355 different advertising networks which covers 98% of the internet. This means you have one LeadFollow account instead of managing 355+ accounts with 355+ different budgets for each account. </p><br/>
        <h2>Understanding how the LeadFollow platform can be used for Existing Audience Campaigns:</h2>
          <p class="lead">With our <a href="https://pages.leadfollow.io/convertmoredirectmail/">LeadFollow Addressable “Direct Mail ROI Buddy”</a> where we GeoFence the USPS Mailing Addresses automatically of your existing leads or clients to display your advertisements via our ad networks, at anyone who lives at that address. All we require here is to have the street address of your leads. <i>(We can upload 1 million addresses per campaign.)</i></p>
          <p class="lead">You can call this digital direct mail that displays your advertising to anyone that lives at a certain property address. This is the foundation for our Direct Mail Buddy ROI Buddy product.  </p>
          <h3 class="text-center">LeadFollow Addressable GeoFencing is like USPS for Digital Ads!</h3>
          <p class="lead">With LeadFollow Addressable Geofencing you can segment your list to specifically target each of your list segments differently. For example <i>New Leads, Warm leads, Cold Leads, Lost Leads, Expired Clients, Current Clients, Lost Clients.</i> This is because we can create list segments to then display your customized advertisements to anyone in these targeted addresses. </p>
          <h3>Using geo-fences to create custom audiences</h3>
          <p class="lead"> Retail Geofence Location Targeting: If you have a retail location or chain of locations we can target the physical locations for people who visit or have visited within a 30 day period of time. </p>
          <p class="lead">This allows you to display ads to your customers who are: (1) In-store right now or (2) Left your retail location within the last 30 days. </p>
          <p class="lead">By creating an geofence audience of people entering your current store locations you can display personalized offers to bring them back into your store. Checkout our Dynamic Ad Creator to see how we can personalize your ads dynamically. </p>

      <h3>Getting customers to come back to your website!</h3>
          <p class="lead">With Website Retargeting you can bring people back to your website. This is where we display ads to your website visitors to bring them back to your website. Amazon attributes 15.7% of their brand awareness to retargeting their current website visitors. Most websites have a bounce rate of 98%. Now with retargeting you can bring these existing customers back to your website. <p class="mt-4 text-center "><a href="https://pages.leadfollow.io/WebsiteVisitorRetargetingCalculator/" class="btn btn-primary">Calculate Your Current Revenue Loss, by NOT using retargeting! </a></p></p>
          <p class="lead">You can personalize your ads based on the pages of your website they viewed. Even if your retargeting now via Facebook, Google or services like Adroll LeadFollow can help you expand your reach and exposure.  </p>

        <h2>Understanding how the LeadFollow platform can be used for New Audience Acquisition:</h2>
        <p class="lead">We leverage the offline intent behavior of your customers to create highly targeted audiences. Here are just some use case examples of what’s possible with the LeadFollow Geo-fencing Software & Retargeting platform.  </p> 
        <p class="lead">GeoFencing physical locations your ideal clients visit in the real world. This can be any physical location that exists on a map anywhere in the world. Here are some basic examples. </p> 
        <ul> 
    <li class ="lead">Competitor locations: <i>Display ads to people who have at your competitors locations, or have recently left their locations.</i></li>
    <li class ="lead">Retail Locations: <i>Target other retail locations that you customers shop.</i> </li>
    <li class ="lead">Restaurants: <i>Target nearby locations that your customers hangout. The different types of restaurants can indicate a different type of customer segment.</i></li>
    <li class ="lead">Banks or Financial services </li>
   <li class ="lead">Car Yards: <i>new, used, repair centers, rental</i> </li>
    <li class ="lead">Professional Services: <i>Where else does your customers shop or interact as part of their customer journey?</i></li>
    <li class ="lead">Display Homes or Sales Centers: <i>This is unique to LeadFollow that we can target locations that are uniquely time based events or evergreen.</i></li>
    <li class ="lead">If it exists on a map it’s a location that can be targeted by LeadFollow Geofencing software. </li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    <h3>Track who’s seen your ads and who walks in!</h3>
    <p class="lead">
    Our system allows us to track who has seen your ads and then walked into your physical locations. We also recommend using a trackable phone number for all banner ads. This allows us to track phone calls from your banner ads. <i>LeadFollow can provide you with a phone number as part of your campaign.</i></p> 
    <h3>With Contextual Retargeting we can display ads to people who are researching!</h3>
    <p class="lead">
    Contextual Display. LeadFollow processes <strong><i>30 terabytes of data per day</i></strong>. This means we process every page your customers visit across the internet and have visited for the last 90 days. This allows us to display your ads at people based on contextual relevance. Based on the keywords on the page itself, or how our big data AI has classified the website. </p> 
    <p class="lead">With contextual display we can retarget based on up to 1,000 keywords, which can include your competitor names, URLs and various key phrases. We have also grouped data on our services to allow you to display based on our category data groups. </p> 
    <p class="lead">Contextual advertising allows you to display your ads to people while they are researching. Allowing you to engage audience at the top of the sales funnel and influence their decisions.</p>

        <p class="lead">LeadFollow is more than just GeoFencing Software Solution. LeadFollow is an entire platform stack of audience creation and audience advertising solutions that can be customized to your specific needs.</p>
        <p class="lead">
          The LeadFollow platform stack has a full suite of technologies that can be layered into your campaign which is optimized around your goals. The graphics below shows a lot of information, but the gist is that the LeadFollow platform is all about stalking your leads online to subconsciously influence buying intent. So no matter where they are, no matter where they are in the customer lifecycle.</p>
        <p class="lead">
        We know that your customers are researching right now online, they are reading blogs, articles and watching videos. And the sad fact is they may not know you exist or even worse have forgotten you exist. They may start to know the type of products that they want or they’re really in the buying stage or they could have been past clients that you’re trying to reactivate and re-engage.</p>
         <p class="lead">
        LeadFollow is perfect for every application of the entire customer lifecycle. I’m going to briefly explain some of the elements of our platform in a high-level. Just a reminder, we’ve got a much more detailed webinar that explain each one of these applications in detail.</p>
          <p class="lead">
        <strong>What about Demographic targeting?</strong>
        If you are spending more than $5,000/month with LeadFollow you campaigns can include demographic layer segmentation. This is just another way you can personalize your marketing to highly targeted audience segments.</p>

        <h2>LeadFollow Behavioural Engagement Platform</h2>
        <p class="lead">To maximize your success you need more than just a geofencing solution. You need a platform of technologies to help you maximize and optimize your success. Geofencing campaigns by themselves will not work. However when you combine geofenced audiences as part of your entire marketing campaign you will improve your results. <i>This is one of the big mistakes that many people make, don’t just look for a cheap GeoFencing solution but a technology that will help you create an asset.</i>Our best clients love that you can leverage our entire platform stack as part of your campaign. <strong>At LeadFollow our goal is to ensure your customers don't forget you!</strong></p>

        <h1><strong>Geofence GeoTargeting</strong></h1>
        <p class="lead">
        Geotargeting is not geofencing. Geo-Fence marketing is not beacon Bluetooth marketing. Did you know that geofencing is not 1-mile or even “1 block” targeting. <br/>
        <br/>
        <div class="col-12 text-center">
        <img alt="How to geofence event geofencing" class="img-fluid rounded-0" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/pages.leadfollow/img/GeoFence-ShoppingCenter.png" width="60%">
        </div>
        <p class="lead">
        Yes, Facebook allows you to radius geotarget 1 mile but that is not really a geofencing solution. It is only a geotarget radius of a certain area. But what is certain in today's marketplace with all of the data we have, and the requirements for reduction of noise in your marketing audiences. A proper geofencing or “proximity marketing” solution can give you a competitive edge. 
        <br/><br/>
        A geofence is a virtual fence placed around the precise area or down to the contours of a building, which is what our LeadFollow platform does. With geofencing, you should be able to granularly target people in individual buildings, malls, retail centers, events, competitors, etc. With LeadFollow Geo-fencing, you can target data to a precise 3 square feet! That means if you want to target a specific retail store or part of a building, you can do that.</p><br/>
        <p class="lead">This is where you can target people based on their location and offline buying intent activity. Like standing in your competitor’s location for example. This provides you with a massive opportunity to build custom audiences with buying intent you can advertise.
        <br/><br/>
        There are multiple geofencing companies out there. This is not new in essence as a technology, however, the way we do it is different. We have three government satellites that validate every transaction. We remove bot traffic and we have a new process for analysing what they call "unstructured data". Unstructed data is like converting a pocket full of pennies into a $100 bill, this is what we do with our big data supercomputer AI. Unlike our competitors we buy our location in data in penny form and interpret it's meaning. This allows us to analyze the data of people who are in starbucks vs everyone who is on the block. The cheaper way to buy data is to buy it in "structured" or chunks like a zip code of data. But this is bad because you know who was in the zip code, and not who was in only the starbucks. This is why we provide you with the LeadFollow Smart Pixel to embed on your websites and landing pages to optimize conversion tracking.
        <br/><br/>
        At any given time, we’re processing close to <i>750 million users over 30 terabytes of time-stamped per data including 1.4 billion.</i> That’s right! <strong>1.4 billion with the B keyword search activities. We process over 3 billion GPS locations per day.</strong> This data allows us to deliver more accurate audiences to save you wasting advertising dollars on the wrong audience segments. We can do things like keyword contextual segmentation for people within a geofenced area. For Example like people looking for a house to buy or sell, or a boat to buy. We have data for the last 6 months that we can consume, analyze, and process to make sure that we can put your marketing messages, your advertising in front of the right people. This is based on their contextual relevant behavior.<i>The exact articles, blogs, videos, content they are consuming right now!</i>

          This is where you can give us a keyword list of up to 500 to 1,000 keywords. What we do is use the broad search as we want higher level keyword search phrases. We’re not talking about exact like longtail keywords here, we’re talking about putting your hands in front of people during the search and research stage of the buying cycle. So your Ads start to display because what we want to do is influence them when they’re researching the products to buy your products. You can only influence people while they’re in that researching stage. Once they’ve locked in on a product, it’s a totally different mental game and buying a game to deal with.</p>

        <h1>Introduction to What is GeoFencing?</h1>
        <div class="col-12 text-center">
        <img alt="How Geofencing works what is geofencing audiences" class="img-fluid rounded-0" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/pages.leadfollow/img/GeoFence-ShoppingCenter.png" width="70%">
        </div>
        <p class="lead">
        Geofencing is a technology that has existed for the last ten years at least. Don't get geofencing confused with Geo-targeting as they are two different things. I explain in more detail below the difference. The challenge with geofencing has been that is has been a technology only available to companies with big budgets typically over $100,000/month minimum. However, LeadFollow is changing the way the industry is working by allowing small to medium size business owners access to the same technology with a starting budget of $500. 
        <br/><br/>
        This allows you to leverage the benefits of Geofencing and retargeting with your existing marketing campaigns. 
        <br/><br/>
        You cannot create highly targeted audiences using peoples offline behavior. We call this behavior buying intent because you know exactly where they are and what they are buying based on their physical location. 
        <br/><br/>
        Even with the power of the internet and e-commerce sites like Amazon.com, people still spend 80% of their budget within an 8-10 mile radius of their home. This means all the professional services this person engages with, all the stores they visit for all of their living needs are local to them. This presents a massive opportunity for you to find new customers.

        But these custom audiences are not limited to just brick and mortar retail stores. You can use these audiences for your online business as well. We have helped E-commerce business clients (people who have stores on Shopify, for example) to target customers who are working into GNC Stores and Vitamin Shoppe, for example. These are highly targeted audiences of people who are buying supplements and health products. So presenting your related products to them via your online ads is hugely beneficial. 
        <br/><br/>
        The old ways of advertising primarily involves frequency and reach using traditional media like television and radio. That’s because these are the easiest ways to promote a business and build supporters. As a result, the industry became dominated by huge companies, while the small retailers were left behind.<br/>
        <br/>
	       Obviously, the changes in how people do business such as the use of technological devices and applications turned the table around. Now, people spend more time in their mobile devices watching videos, reading the news or checking the weather. And for that reason opportunities to reach audience and drive awareness were afforded to all businesses including small retailers.<br/>

        <h2>How does targeted display work? </h2>
        <p class="lead">The best way to make someone understand how targeted display works is to simply show. Here’s what the process looks like: </p>
        <div class="col-12 text-center">
        <img alt="image" class="img-fluid rounded-0" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/pages.leadfollow/img/image3.png" width="70%">
        </div>
        <div class="col-12 text-left">
        <p class="lead">As you can see, the concept of targeted display is pretty simple. When an internet user searches a keyword online, that data will be used to determine what advertisement he or she should get. If the user previously read a content, that history will also define Ads that will be shown. This means that based on the content you are consuming (reading or watching) your ads will be personalized to you. This is also a great lead generation opportunity as you can gain exposure to customers while they are researching solutions.<br/>
        <br/>
        Demographics is another data that is layered onto display Ads to that have specific conditions. For example, if the advertisement is for people aged 30 to 40 or the advertisement is for women only, the demographic data will make it easier to target the right audience.</p>

        <h2>Why display advertising? </h2>
        <p class="lead"> 
        There are many reasons why display advertising is gaining popularity. Its ability to reach consumers based on human interest, trait and preferences favored the advertisers.<br/>
        <br/>
        First of all, it it is a visually appealing advert compared to others. Because the internet is drowning in Ads, advertisers must ensure that their creatives are nothing short of amazing. Take a look at the samples below. Creating ads that get attention is about our RFD formula.</p>
        <img alt="image" class="img-fluid rounded-0" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/pages.leadfollow/img/image4.png">
        <p class="lead"> Choosing the right color combination plays an important role in the success of the online advertisement. Color evoke emotions in the viewer. Take the McDonald’s advertisement, for example. Its red and yellow combination easily excites people. Look at how irresistible that burger appears thanks to the perfect color scheme used. <br/>
        <br/>
        Second, it makes the most out of your marketing budget. With display targeting, you can ensure that the efficiency of your budget.
        </p>
        <div class="col-12 text-left">
        <p class="lead"> Another benefit of targeted Ads is it supports brand awareness. How likely is it that a consumer will purchase from a brand that he or she doesn’t know? The same logic applies to online advertisements. In the world of advertising, display ads are the heroes because they do the work without the advertisers having to sell anything. It creates awareness and drive people to the brand. In other words, you are getting in front of high-quality prospects. You customer needs to see your advertising 20 before they will engage. The challenge with this is keeping the Recency, Frequency and Duration (RFD Formula) active to subconsciously influence your customers. This is why we specify a minimum of 4 banner ad impressions per day for 30 days.<br/>

        <strong>One mistake that you don’t want to make is reaching out to the wrong audience or people who do not have interest in your product or service.</strong> This happens a lot using traditional advertising. Let’s say you have a billboard intended to attract male audience who are keen on sports. But here’s the thing, with this kind of strategy you’re reaching all types of audiences since you cannot control people who will see the advertisement.<br/>
        <br/>
        Conversely, using display advertisement and geofencing together will allow you to use resources wisely by targeting the right people. These are the audience who are actually showing intent or interest in your business. Something that other marketing tactics can’t perform.<br/>
        <br/>
        Geofencing campaign comes with a platform where you can define the geofence, add proximity and duration. It allows convenience of putting a boundary and tracking activities, that in turn you can use to evaluate your investment return.<br/>
        <br/> 
        Lastly, you can target potential customers with more impact using targeted display. It increases the impact your communication creates on the prospects. For example, the prospect is reading a particular content and then sees your display advertisement. The target audience will then click on the advert. And if not, the audience will remember your promo or message and when he or she is ready to take action, you will be the first name that will pop up in their head.

 # Geofencing and Retargeting Frequently Asked Questions:

 ## What does Geofencing do that’s different than Google ads?

 `youtube: https://youtu.be/dH29fCmz_Rs`

 <br/> 

Geofencing is used to create custom audiences of people based on their offline behavior. Google can only create custom audience via their online search when you use Google.com search query, less than 4 searches per person per day which takes less than 2 minutes on average. The other way that Google allows you to target your ads is by using Geotargeting. This is where you can create geo-location zones that you display your ads, these are usually a city, county, zip code or 5 mile radius. 

<div class="col-12 text-center">
        <img alt="GeoFencing Vs Geotargeting" class="img-fluid" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/pages.leadfollow/img/GeoFencing Vs Geotargeting (1).png">
      </div>

Geo-Fencing allows you to be as accurate as 100 square feet <i>(Starbucks size)</i>. This allows you to target people who walk into a Starbucks for example vs people who are in the Zip code. With Geo-Fencing you can get more accurate in the audiences you create because of their specific offline behaviors.  

Google displays ads to people based on their online searches using the Google search query. 

With Geo-fencing you create custom audiences based on people’s offline behaviors like attending an event/expo, or walking into a certain business to then display your ads which can be either banner ads or video ads. 

## If LeadFollow does not advertise on Google Search or Facebook ads network where do we advertise?

<br/>
It's our goal to follow your customers around the internet during their daily experience and optimize your ad impressions based on who your are targeting to create brand awareness and dominance in the mind of your customers. We want your customers to see your ads at least 4 times per day, every day for an extended period of time. This is how you can subconsciously influence your customer to engage with your company. 

<div class="col-12 text-center">
        <img alt="GeoFencing Vs Geotargeting" class="img-fluid" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/pages.leadfollow/img/AdsNetworkDisplay.jpg" width='80%'>
      </div>

Currently we don’t publish ads to the Google search query or the Facebook ads network because these are closed networks that are controlled by their relevant companies. We do however publish to the Google Display Network and Goole Ad Network via the DoubleClick Ad Exchange <i>(this is Google's ad publishing company)</i>. 

<div class="col-12 text-center">
        <img alt="GeoFencing Vs Geotargeting" class="img-fluid" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/pages.leadfollow/img/AdNetwork-Images.jpeg" width='80%'>
      </div>

What you need to be aware is there is two types of Google ad networks, there is Google Search and there is Google Ads network. The Google Search Network uses the data from search boxes on websites that have a search bar. So any website has a search bar, is a data point for keyword based ad discovery. The Google ads networks are all the website that are using Google (Google Adsense) to control the ads that are placed on their websites. The site owner then get’s paid by google for placing these ads on their website. (This is the role of the ad network.) 

For example if I have a website and I want to get paid for placing ads on my site, but don’t want to have to deal with selling the ad space. I can contract companies that are called Ad Networks to manage all of this for me. This is where LeadFollow comes in. We have integrated with these ad networks to publish your ads onto 98% of the internet via 355+ different ad networks. 

<div class="col-12 text-center">
        <img alt="GeoFencing Vs Geotargeting" class="img-fluid" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/pages.leadfollow/img/AdNetwork-Images2.jpeg" width='80%'>
      </div>

Instead of you just using one ad network like Google Ad network you can use LeadFollow and publish to over 355+ different ad networks.  Your ads are displayed on various apps (over 600,000 apps and games) including Angry Birds, Words with Friends, Weather.com, ESPN etc etc. Your Ads are also displayed one various websites via our 355+ advertising publishing networks. We give you real-time reporting of each location your ads have been placed as we follow your users around the internet. 

LeadFollow also makes use of the contextual keyword discovery because we process 30 Terabytes of user data a day. This means our systems are analyzing the content you are consuming and based on that we can display your ads. So if a person is reading a page, or watching a video that matches one of your 1,000 keywords we can then trigger your ads to display. This allows us to display your ads to customers based on the content they are viewing or have viewed within the last 30 days.

      </div>

##  If people search on Google will they see our ads? 

No, if people search on Google.com using a search query they will nope see the ads. However based on the website that loads in the search results and the other content that the user is reading, or engaged with can trigger the display of the ads via our advertising networks. Users will only be seeing your ads based on if they have already been to your website and you are using our website visitor retargeting or they have applied a keyword contextual display element to your campaign.

         That's right the internet is larger than Facebook and Google. According to a recent study, the average American spends 10.6 hours per day online. Less than 2 minutes or 4 searches per day is on Google.com. There are forums, blogs, new websites, video sites, TV streaming services and the list goes on. 
          <br/><br/>
         Just think about the websites that you visit daily. Or the Apps that you use, when you use. 
        </p>
        <ul class="lead">
        <li>When you wake up which websites do you browse or apps do you use? </li>

        Geofencing and retargeting advertising solutions can gain 97% more reach than your traditional geo-targeting (zip code) marketing campaign.

        GeoFencing integrates with your existing offline marketing channels to provide real-time tracking and analytics.

        <p class="lead">
          90% of people typically have their geolocation services turned on for their mobile device. Many of the apps you use on a daily basis or websites you visit require you location. For example if you have done any of the following it's likely that your location services are on: 
        </p>
        <ul class="lead">
        <li>Used Apple maps, Google Maps, Waze or other mapping application. </li>
        <li>Checked the weather  </li>
        <li> Said <i>"Siri/Alexa/Google ______ near me?"</i></li>
        <li> Visited Amazon.com, Walmart.com, Alibaba.com </li>
        <li> Looked for a bank atm near me</li>
        <li> Used Lyft or Uber</li>
        <li> Used a food delivery app </li>
        <li> Ordered a pizza </li>
        <li> Looked up sports team score. </li>
        <li> Purchased concert tickets  </li>
        <li> Looked up flight information </li>
        <li> Booked a flight</li>
        <li> Looked up hotel information</li>
        <li> Booked a hotel</li>
        <li> Used social media like Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok, WeChat, Youtube.</li>
        <li> And about 1,000 more different things, I am sure you get the idea. </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lead">
        It would be harder to find someone that has location services off! And let's face it if you do find those people what are the chances they are your ideal customer? <i>And are all of these people your only customer… didn't think so. Because if they are you are not an ideal candidate for geofencing.</i>

        <h2>Using GeoFencing to track online advertising offline like your walk-in foot traffic</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          Let me ask you a question. Can you successfully track your TV, Billboard, Radio and or direct mail ads? Can you track how many of these people have walked into your store because of them? 
          <br/><br/>
          You can track if you are using special offers or coupon codes. But just because I received your postcard does not mean I didn't walk into your store without the coupon. This happens all the time! 
          <br/><br/>
          With our LeadFollow geo-fencing conversion zone tracking we can track the people who see your ads and then walk into your stores. This is because the person has seen your ad on their device and this device is usually in their pocket or hand when they walk into your store. Therefore giving you their location data.

        <p class="lead">
          The process is simple. </p>
        <ol class="lead">
        <li> We set up a geo-fence target zone around the area you want to target like your competitor's location. </li>
        <li> Then we set up a conversion zone around one or more of YOUR locations. <i>That's right we can have up to 1,000 conversion zones per campaign!</i></li>
        <li> When the customer enters your competitor's location we start tracking their information. They see your ads online. </li>
        <li> When the customer enters the conversion zone with their device which has previously been served ads and tracked at the competitor's location. The LeadFollow system will validate this data and register it as a Conversion.  </li>
        </ol>
          <p class="lead">
         Now you can track who is seeing your ads and then walking into your stores. I am sure you might be getting some ideas. Yes, you can use this with your direct mail campaigns to track who you are sending direct mail and how many of those people are visiting your conversion zone locations. There are many use cases and we are more than happy to discuss them with you.</p>

        <h2>Measuring  GeoFencing and Retargeting Success</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          Ways you can track campaign effectiveness and optimization. Results cannot be guaranteed, and should not be considered typical. Results may vary from client to client. You should monitor the data from a campaign for up to 90 days after the campaign ends on LeadFollow. 
          <br/><br/>
          What's certain is that we can help you build your brand awareness and help you build new audiences with buying intent that you can market. Here are several ways you can track the success of your LeadFollow Geofencing and Retargeting campaigns.
        </p>
        <ol class="lead">
        <li> Impressions delivered - Highly targeting Ads are being delivered to a highly targeted audience  </li>
        <li> Click through rate - how many people see the ads and click them? <i>A good rate is 1% anything above 1% is considered very good.</i></li>
        <li> View through rate - this is very unique and cool. Now that we have the smart pixel installed we can tell you how many people that your ad was delivered to that later directly searched for your company by name. Example: They saw the ad 3 times at work and when they got home they searched for your company by name.</li>
        <li> Increased phone calls, and sales (over time) They way these Ads work is helping to influence their decisions throughout their buyer's journey. Consistently seeing your Ads, Logo and brand message will help reinforce you as the option to work with when they are ready. LeadFollow can provide you with a trackable phone number to use in your campaigns.</li>
        <li> Increased web traffic - Start to track traffic analytics of website traffic as well as a decreased bounce rate. You will notice an increase in direct search traffic.</li>
        <li> Better quality visitors and leads- Generally the quality of traffic to your site improves over time as well as the quality of leads.</li>
        <li> Visitors' time on site and number of page views.</li>
        <li> Building an audience of highly qualified and targeted people you can display your brand message to without having to spend $50k on a booth and deal with "running" the expo.</li>
        <li> Driving this newly collected audience to a page where the can be pixeled and retargeted long term as well as the opportunity to collect their contact info through lead capture forms.</li>
        <li> Using the LeadFollow SmartLink tool to create audiences based on the people who click on the content and links you share on your social media unique to LeadFollow!</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="lead">
        For example with one client, we helped them bring back 887 people to their website, which resulted in a 35% increase in the request for demo's that month. <i> means we helped them recapture leads who have left their website previous and help get these customers back into the sales funnel.</i> How many customers are leaving your website?

        <h1>Cost of GeoFencing and Retargeting Campaigns</h1>
        <p class="lead">
          What's the cost of the Geofencing campaign or what should I budget?</p>
        <p class="lead">
        This is a great question and the only way you can answer it is by understanding what we call the impression math. At LeadFollow we offer geofencing and retargeting based on impressions, not clicks, not call and not leads. Impressions is the metric that creates all of the clicks, calls, form fills and client walk-ins. So the questions become really how many impressions are needed to influence your leads. Therefore programmatic display advertising is not like Facebook ads or Google AdWords or Bing Ads because it's billed per impression.</p>
         <p class="lead">
        An impression is when an Ad via a mobile app or website passes your line of site or purview. Similar to your driving past a billboard or listening to a radio spot, those count as impressions. CPM is Cost Per Impressions and is billed in units of 1,000 impressions. So a $15/cpm is $15.00 per 1,000 impressions. The cost of banner ad impressions is different to video ad impressions. <br/><br/>
        There are several variables that influence your impressions:
        </p>
        <ul class="lead">
        <li>Who are your targeting? </li>
        <li>Your offer</li>
        <li>How recent was their intent action? </li>
        <li>How well do they know you?</li>
        <li>What stage of the customer journey are they? </li>
        <li>Short sale cycle or long sales cycle?</li>
        <li>How are you connecting with them around the impressions of the LeadFollow campaign? </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="lead">
        These are all important questions you need to ask yourself and understand. If we were to provide you with a rule of thumb we recommend to clients that they allocate 20% of their advertising budget to geofencing and retargeting campaigns. 
        <br/><br/>
        For example we had one client use retargeting alone to bring 887 people back to their website, which resulted in a 35% increase in requests for demo's. 
        <br/><br/>
        Your Cost Per Impression (CPM) varies based on the advertising networks we are using to display impressions to your leads. It's recommended to deliver 4 impressions per day per person you want to target for 30 days at least. This results in a $1 per person for a 30-day campaign. 
        <br/><br/>
        I recommend that you mix video ads with static banner ads and within your creative flight you can have 3-6 different types of video ads and banner ads in one campaign. Rotating your ads helps with brand awareness and recall awareness.

        <h2>How to create the right geofencing campaign strategy </h2>
        <p class="lead">
         There are many factors that will influence the results of your geofencing and retargeting campaign. Like any other marketing campaign it needs to be optimized over a period of 3 months. (90 days)
         <br/><br/>
         Here are some of the factors that will influence your campaigns: 
          </p>
         <ul class="lead">
         <li>Target audience</li>
         <li>Behaviors of this target audience</li>
         <li>Offers to this audience <i>Yes, more than 1 offer</i></li>
         <li>Recency, Frequency, Duration of campaigns</li>
         <li>Creative Flight Rotation</li>
         <li>Using Video or Not using video</li>
         <li>Your website <i>Is it fast and mobile responsive with 80% of traffic coming from mobile devices.</i></li>
         <li>Do you have a landing page or website that converts your website traffic and are you optimizing this?</li>
         </ul>
        <p class="lead">
        When you are reviewing your campaign strategy, you need to be very clear on what your goal is. For example: </p>
        <ul class="lead">
         <li>Do you want store foot traffic? </li>
         <li>Do you want impressions and awareness?</li>
         <li>Awareness because you are calling the target audience and want I higher connection rate.</li>
         <li>Brand engagement on other channels like social media.</li>
         <li>Lead Capture or Form fills.</li>
         <li>Phone calls or website chat engagements.</li>
         </ul>
         <p class="lead">
          These are just some of the engagement metrics you need to be aware of with your campaign goals. Because you can experience all of these as part of one campaign, it's hard to achieve one of these without the other when using these type of branding campaign.

        <h2>Do you know your Geo-fence audience? </h2>
        <p class="lead">It sounds like a simple question, but how well do you know your geofence audience? </p>
        <p class="lead">
        Have you created a buying persona and know their emotions and how to trigger and engage them. Are they price sensitive and what will trigger them to engage with your marketing campaign? </p>
         <p class="lead">
        For example, knowing what your target audience is experiencing and doing prior and after the geofence target area. Where do they go after, what do they do for the next 30 days after this geofenced area? Who are they seeing, are they in pain? What are their fears, desires, frustrations?</p>
         <p class="lead">
        Being able to answer these questions will allow you to design better creative that captivates their attention. Remember you are not speaking to everyone here. You are only targeting a very specific person so make sure you speak directly to that person.</p>
        <p class="lead">
        There are other simple examples like if you are geo-fencing a shopping mall what is the mall layout. Is there a cheaper end to the mall and an expensive end? Is there are movie theater or food/bar area that you want to include or exclude in your target zone.</p>

          It sounds like a simple question, but how well do you know your geofence audience? </p>
        <p class="lead">
        Some of the simple locations to think about are as follows:</p>
        <ul class="lead">
        <li>Your Current Location </li>
        <li>Visiting</li>
        <li>Leaving (Recency)</li>
        <li>Your 4 block Area</li>
        <li>Competitor Location</li> 
        <li>Client Hangouts or places their frequent</li>
        </ul>
         <p class="lead">
        If you want to think about expanding this audience here are some strategies we call advanced custom audience expansion:</p>
        <ul class="lead">
        <li>Your Client List</li>
        <li>Addressable </li>
        <li>Contextual Search</li>
        <li>Category Display</li>
        </ul>
         <p class="lead">
        Your campaign does not need to be just about the Click through Rate (CTR). If can be about educating your clients via the banner ads or videos. Think of your banner ads or video ads as another way to distribute your content, create awareness and engage your audience in the content you are creating. </p>
